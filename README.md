This website is implemented using HTML and other technologies and methodologies of visual design learned at Java Developer course by PerScholas.
Some effort to make it styling looking good and user-friendly have been made.

We believe in **WYSIWYG (What you see is what you get)** so this project uses many visual resources to display visitors of the website what SALANGO Kitchen has to offer.
